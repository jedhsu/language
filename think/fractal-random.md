Consider a countably infinite string.

The following exist in that string:
* Every programming language exists in that string.
* If the energy of the universe converges, then....

### Random pseudo theoretical thoughts
* Wittgenstein's language-game is early form of [lexical information](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/syntax-model.html#%28tech._lexical._information%29)
* Types are a bounding of a more, and nothing more. Importantly, they are **not** "fundamental".
* Wittgenstein's point was that there is lexical information, before computer science as invented.
* A higher-level syntax form is a fractal.
* The issue with Hilbert's program is that the [intuition](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/) for axioms to be "well-defined" is "dense" within the language system. More concretely, for "A is false" to have "unambiguous meaning" is "dense" within formal logic.

* to "understand" axioms is "dense" within the axioms.
