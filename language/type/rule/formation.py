    *Product Formation*   A, B: Type  _proves_  A x B: Type

  An element here amounts to a construction taking an element of A
  to an element of B. In the case of mere propositions, an element
  of the function type is a proof of the implication, a mapping
  of a warrant for A to a warrant of B. (Corfield 39)
