"""

Due to the flexibility of types, should they even be called
type anymore? Rather than just some other terminology?

Fundamentall,y it feels like a parametrizable "shadow" of an object's structure.

  e.g. Matrix vs Matrix[3,4]

Even more fundamentally, feels like just an "order of algorithms" issue.

Types are considered operators at this point.
